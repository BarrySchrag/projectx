Plan to categorize any motion through analysis of sub-atomic action sequences
    From a video stream, pick out one or more region candidates containing significant change
Tag and track regions separately, not switching between them
    Detect the external contour which encompasses the region of change
    Capture a bounding box of this contour, and show it on screen
            Extract the motion vectors contained in the matched region in the bounding box between frames
                Keep a between frame history of the set of vectors related to the object
                Calculate statistics for these vectors over time
                Partition the stream of vectors into time series groups based on:
                    When the statistics are outside the norm, become reversed or have extreme deviations
                Reformat time series grouped vectors into histograms (one for angle and magnitude)
            Extract attributes which are within the boundary including but not limited to:
                Luminance
                Texture Size, Frequency and Orientation
                Scale (extent of the object)
            Concurrently determine if there is any time frequency component associated with the attributes including motion vectors

Build a Data Set
    Design requirements for a data set of basic actions, create training data, label
Execute:
    Feed the histograms to a Time Series NN, in with the goal to predict the next partitioned set of the sequence
Analyze Result
    After training, analyze with PCA, NMPI, extract hierarchy, determine relevance to predictability
    Run on the AVA dataset.
