//In order to use GOTURN tracker, GOTURN architecture goturn.prototxt and goturn.caffemodel are > required to exist in root folder.
//There are 2 ways to get caffemodel:
//1 - Train you own GOTURN model using https://github.com/Auron-X/GOTURN_Training_Toolkit
//2 - Download pretrained caffemodel from https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra
As the OpenCV Extra repo doesn't seem to contain any Goturn caffemodel, pretrained or otherwise.
I downloaded it from http://cs.stanford.edu/people/davheld/public/GOTURN/trained_model/tracker.caffemodel instead.
Is that is what is intended, or is it some other .caffemodel file one is supposed to use?

find / -name "goturn.prototxt"
https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/c4219d5eb3105ed8e634278fad312a1a8d2c182d/testdata/tracking

The above error seems to be caused by the mismatching of the goturn.prototxt file.
I received the file from the following site.
Https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/c4219d5eb3105ed8e634278fad312a1a8d2c182d/testdata/tracking
The following command merge four files into one.
cat goturn.caffemodel.zip.001 goturn.caffemodel.zip.002 goturn.caffemodel.zip.003 goturn.caffemodel.zip.004 > goturn.caffemodel
