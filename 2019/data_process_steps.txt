Overall Dataflow Architecture for V1
The Phone to takes video data and sends it up where it is processed. 

Phone to Server Data collection:  
1. Phone records video continuously, splitting into 1 minute intervals. Tools: IP WebCam or other
2. Phone has background process to upload video interval 30 minutes.  Tools:  DriveSync or other
3. Server Storage previously setup:  Tools: Google Drive, OneDrive, or direct to server via Resilio Sync 

V1 Server Processing Architecture:
0. Import google drive mp4 files
   drive pull Google\ Photos\2019
1. Convert Inbound 1 minute RGB video to Grayscale - 2.6MB/7.6MB = 34% of original size, alternate format=gray 2% larger
  ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf hue=s=0 ./processed/input_gray.mp4  
2. Export audio at 48K sample rate
  fmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec mp3 ./processed/input_audio.mp3
3. Remove original file to save space
  rm input.mp4
4. Execute: Vector + Grayscale combiner
   /projectx/optical-flow-filter/demos/flowWebCam/build$ ./flowWebCam -i "/home/barry/gdrive/Google Photos/2019/processed/input_gray.mp4" -f RGB -o "/home/barry/gdrive/Google Photos/2019/processed/input-rgb.avi" -r 50 -c "X264" 
5. Execute: Detect audio start sequence of ppt tones as generated here 
   # export frequencies to a text file
   aubiopitch ./processed/input_audio.mp3 > ./processed/input_audio.txt // https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/aubio/latest/aubio.pdf
   # determine 800hz frequency
   egrep '^.{10}80[0-9].' input41_audio.txt
   # determine 3200hz frequency lines and extract the exact second when the event occured
   a=$(egrep '^.{10}32[0-9][0-9]' input41_audio.txt | grep -o '^[^.]\+' | uniq --count | sort -nr | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')
   

#6  Execute: Process for pantomimes - merge videos, split, move to appropriate folders
# merge videos w/concat demuxer: Use when you want to avoid a re-encode and your format does not support file level concatenation 
$ cat mylist.txt
file '/path/to/file1'
file '/path/to/file2'
file '/path/to/file3'
$ ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output
